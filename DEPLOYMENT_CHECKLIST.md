# Vercel Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Build Configuration
- [x] `vite.config.ts` is clean (no Replit plugins in production)
- [x] `package.json` has correct build scripts
- [x] `vercel.json` is properly configured
- [x] `.vercelignore` excludes unnecessary files

### 2. Environment Variables
- [ ] All required environment variables are documented
- [ ] Production values are ready
- [ ] No sensitive data in code

### 3. Build Test
- [x] `npm run build` works locally
- [x] `dist/index.html` is generated
- [x] All assets are properly referenced

## ✅ Deployment Steps

### 1. Vercel Dashboard
- [ ] Connect Git repository
- [ ] Set framework preset to "Other"
- [ ] Configure build settings:
  - Build Command: `npm run build`
  - Output Directory: `dist`
  - Install Command: `npm install`

### 2. Environment Variables
- [ ] Add all required environment variables
- [ ] Use production values
- [ ] Test API endpoints after deployment

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Main page loads correctly (not showing JS code)
- [ ] API endpoints work (`/api/test`)
- [ ] Static assets load properly
- [ ] No console errors

## 🔧 Common Fixes

### If showing JavaScript code instead of UI:
1. ✅ Check `vercel.json` routing configuration
2. ✅ Ensure `dist/index.html` exists
3. ✅ Verify build process completed successfully
4. ✅ Check that static assets are properly served

### If build fails:
1. ✅ Remove Replit-specific plugins from `vite.config.ts`
2. ✅ Check all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. ✅ Verify TypeScript compilation
4. ✅ Check for missing environment variables

### If API doesn't work:
1. Verify environment variables are set
2. Check serverless function logs
3. Test API endpoints individually
4. Verify database connections

## 📝 Notes

- The app should be accessible at `your-domain.vercel.app`
- API endpoints are at `your-domain.vercel.app/api/*`
- Health check endpoint: `your-domain.vercel.app/api/test`
- All routes should serve `index.html` for SPA routing

## 🚨 Issue Resolution

The main issue where your app was showing JavaScript code instead of the React UI has been resolved by:

1. **Removing Replit plugins** from `vite.config.ts`
2. **Fixing Vercel routing** in `vercel.json`
3. **Updating build scripts** in `package.json`
4. **Cleaning HTML template** to remove Replit scripts

Your deployment should now work correctly!
